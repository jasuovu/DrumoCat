# DrumoCat

The DrumoCat program is an interactive application developed in Processing using the Java programming language that connects to a MIDI e-drum kit. At its core, the program features a cat character situated behind a drum kit, whose arms move to strike the corresponding drum parts on-screen with preloaded sound files (e.g., snare.wav, kick.wav) providing the audio.

Key features include recording drum inputs, saving sequences, and applying transformations like quantization (snapping beats to a tempo) and BPM adjustments (modifying timestamps rather than playback speed). Additional tools include an MP3 player, BPM tapper, metronome, intro trimming, and drumbeat visualizers.
